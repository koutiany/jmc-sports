            <p>A difficult concept for me in the reading this week was understanding the Turnen movement as a political vehicle for the middle class of 19th century Germany. As a hub of connection and community for the middle class, gymnastics clubs and gyms became spaces for organization, and they “acted as a pressure group for popular demands concerning body culture, movement, health and physical education, not only in clubs but also in schools” (410). The Turners were able to unite Germany on a national scale through sports and movement, and though they lost their status/usefulness as a political entity in the end, they became a cultural symbol of German nationalism. Their strength and unity in the movements that they practiced represented allegiance to the German state, but also to one another, and this was ingrained in Germans in their schooling. Also, the question Titi asked at the end of class made me think, “are the gymnastics from the article the same sport as gymnastics in the documentary?” I think these sports still represent loyalty and pride to one’s nation, especially when one is representing their country in a competition for glory; however, gymnastics has evolved past being a useful political movement and as training for war purposes for the middle class, and is therefore distinctly different. Again, gymnastics today, through national competitions like the Olympics, are a symbolic form of national pride and devotion, rather than a cohesive political movement.

            <h2 class="display-4">Reflection on week 2</h2>
            <p>In the FIFA official film, there was a singular narrative of a collective Brazil being formed through the commitment to winning the 2014 World Cup. This was true of the different people they interviewed for the film, from the Gaucho to the indigenous peoples in the Amazonas region, to the amputee that plays for Brazil. All of these people, despite their many differences, found a Brazilian identity through their love of football and hopes for the Brazilian team to win the World Cup. While I do think that sports, and football in particular, foster a sense of national belonging and community among people with different identities, FIFA glosses over the nuance of this ‘collective identity’ and issues that multicultural societies face in their film. In the academic reading we did for this meeting, the authors discuss “celebratory racism” in their analysis of media portrayals of the multicultural 2010 German national soccer team. They state that media commentators and politicians used racialized language and essentializing cultural stereotypes to “celebrate” diversity of the team and express excitement (110). The way the media racialized non-ethnically German members of the team, even as an attempt to say they were excited to have them on the team, solidified them as “others,” and therefore not really German nationals.
In the academic reading, we are being told to be critical of casual racism in the form of complementary remarks, in the FIFA film, they do the exact opposite of this. The FIFA film does not critically interrogate the struggles that native Amazonians face, nor the struggles of the working class, but rather, would like to use these identities as bargaining chips to show how inclusive FIFA is, and how the love of football “erases” these differences in favor of a collective national identity. Though there is no discussion of the ethnicities of the Brazilian players themselves in the film, the way that the fans have their narratives used for the objective of making a corrupt organization like FIFA look better, is very similar to the phenomenon discussed in the reading.

            <h2 class="display-4">Reflection on week 3</h2>
            <p>This week, in our discussion, we talked in depth about the deep associations between football Hooliganism and Russian rightwing politics. In the article that we read, “The Rise of Russia’s Neo-Nazi Football Hooligans,” the author makes many connections in how these concepts go hand in hand, by taking us through the life and career of Russian neo-Nazi Dennis Nikitin. Nikitin was attracted to hooliganism because of the overly-masculine, violent, and racist culture of the football fans, and because it could advance his career prospects as well. In fact, the recruitment of many hooligans begins with young, isolated men with little career prospects; it takes them and gives them a purpose and a place to expend their energy to. The overly nationalistic (and far-right) attitudes of hooliganism are predicated on racism and xenophobia towards non-Slavik (or, more broadly, non-European) immigrants and peoples. The added benefit of a possible political career (of being a bodyguard) is attractive to men who join hooligan firms, and increases their loyalty to the state.
	For this week, we had to create a visualization of this article’s concepts and how they are interconnected. Above, there is a word cloud that I created by imputing the entire word count of the article into voyant tools. The largest words and concepts are the most used in the article, and the smallest words are those that were used the least frequently. “Football” was used the most at 42 hits, “hooligans” had 41 hits, “Nikitin” had 35 hits, “fans” at 25 hits, and “violence” had 22 hits. The size of these terms is what draws their attention, and by looking at them while not focusing on the smaller terms presented, most of them (besides “violence”) seem like harmless concepts. It is only when you zoom in that you see terms such as “far” and “right” (16 and 15 hits, respectively), “neo” and “Nazi” (7 and 9 hits, respectively), and “racist” (8 hits). The visual effect of this word map is similar to the effect of watching fans like the hooligans at first glance. It is really easy to see hooligan groups as crazy fans that get a little overexcited for their teams, and miss the underlying web of connections that they have to right-wing extremism and nationalism that elicits neo-Nazi propaganda. That is not to say that one will not observe overt racism, like the racist chanting that they do, but to realize that there is a distinct connection to the state and the inner workings of politics itself is often overlooked.
