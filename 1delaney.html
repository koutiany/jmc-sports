            <p>A difficult concept for me in the reading this week was understanding the Turnen movement as a political vehicle for the middle class of 19th century Germany. As a hub of connection and community for the middle class, gymnastics clubs and gyms became spaces for organization, and they “acted as a pressure group for popular demands concerning body culture, movement, health and physical education, not only in clubs but also in schools” (410). The Turners were able to unite Germany on a national scale through sports and movement, and though they lost their status/usefulness as a political entity in the end, they became a cultural symbol of German nationalism. Their strength and unity in the movements that they practiced represented allegiance to the German state, but also to one another, and this was ingrained in Germans in their schooling. Also, the question Titi asked at the end of class made me think, “are the gymnastics from the article the same sport as gymnastics in the documentary?” I think these sports still represent loyalty and pride to one’s nation, especially when one is representing their country in a competition for glory; however, gymnastics has evolved past being a useful political movement and as training for war purposes for the middle class, and is therefore distinctly different. Again, gymnastics today, through national competitions like the Olympics, are a symbolic form of national pride and devotion, rather than a cohesive political movement.

            <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane.
