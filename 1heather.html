            <p>From our first reading and discussion, what struck me the most is how, from its creation, gymnastics was more than a sport. While the gymnastics clubs seemed to serve many functions - as meeting places, hosts for people to articulate their needs, and facilitators of nationalist feelings - gymnastics itself proposed more than just a new way of exercising. Gymnastics itself seemed to be a symbol and expression of unification. Gymnastics offers synchronized movement, but also symbolizes unity by its widespread access. It was not a sport of the elite. Furthermore, gymnastics created to some extent a culture that promoted unity to its participants. This culture, according to the reading, was “a combination of romanticism, idealism and private sentimentality coupled with an emphasis on national pride, glory and power” (411). This culture was further promoted by the Turner Festivals where gymnastics, songs, poems, and common colors and flags were shared. I found it interesting how this culture seemed to transform over the years but its potential to promote unity has remained. I can observe this in gymnastics today from the culture of tight-knit local gyms to gymnastics at the olympics where citizens come together to cheer on their national team.

            <p>Generally, it seems that national teams reflect their home’s national identity. Looking at the national German football team, the coverage of major football events allows for the ethnically diverse team to present a diverse German identity. However, this image may be somewhat misleading. Along with Germany’s national team being considerably diverse, they also seem united. Germany is becoming a more ethnically diverse national especially considering the large influxes of immigrants in past years. However, with this large influx of immigration, there has also been a lot of tension. According to Stehle and Weber’s article, focusing on the 2010 World Cup, the diverse national team has prompted celebrations of German multiculturalism. However, Chancellor Merkel announced the failure of multiculturalism in Germany the same year (103). This prompts the question of whether the attention of Germany’s national team is encouraging the country to embrace multiculturalism or distracting from this mission by presenting an image of unification and diversity that may lead people to falsely believe that it has already been achieved.

            <p>This week we discussed a sub-culture of football - hooliganism. Hooligans are more than just streetfighters fighting for the pride of their national team or nation. Many people seem to embrace the hooligan culture as it offers a sense of brotherhood and a chance to make something of themselves. It seems that many of the members were lacking opportunities before they joined a hooligan club. Hooliganism seemed an attractive option to men struggling to find work in the post-soviet economy especially. Until more recently, it seemed that there had been some not-so-suddle collaboration between governments and hooligans - in Russia especially. Some politicians, mostly from the far right, have supported in some not so covert ways. According to the article this week, Russian politician, Igor Lebedev, publicly encouraged Russian hooligans in a tweet (Parkin). Politicians have also made work for hooligans as bodyguards or even party officials in exchange for help in turning away certain voters. Other themes of hooligan culture besides brotherhood and opportunity, include hyper-masculinity and intolerance. Hooliganism is obviously very violent, but violence seems to be associated with power, respect, pride, and masculinity. Further, this violence is not only targeted at the hooligans of the opposing team, but ethnic and racial minorities. To create this word cloud, I used the description of our discussion in the paragraph above. The main words that appeared are Hooligans, brotherhood, politicians, work, culture, pride, violence, and team. I think these words accurately reflect the themes and topics of hooligan culture. Pride, violence, and brotherhood seem to be at the core of hooligan culture. Further, politicians, work, and the national team are all important associations of the culture.
