            <p> I found the discussion in the first class extremely interesting. Before the readings for this honors option, I had never thought about how sports (or specifically gymnastics) could also influence social relations and politics. I had thought about how sports are used to express nationalism, but the reading definitely made me think on a deeper level about the real impact sports have on policy. For example, the reading talked about how gymnastic clubs impacted relations between different social classes in Germany, which I had never considered before. Also, it came up briefly in our discussion, but I always find myself very interested in the inequalities existing within sports culture. For example, the original gymnastics clubs in Germany, as described in the reading, were for middle class men. Meaning, women were left out of the socialization that occurred within the gyms during this time. To this day, we can still see sports made exclusively for men (ex. American football). Also, even when women do participate in the sports, there are large disparities between women’s and men’s leagues. The discussion in class really made me think about those ideas, and I hope to explore them more throughout the rest of this course!

            <p>After studying the connection between sports and nationalism more this week, I have begun to think about how a lot of people use sports as an outlet for expressing pride for their country. Especially during world sports tournaments (the world cup, the olympics, etc.), people begin to express extreme pride for their country. For some people, it seems that it becomes more than just a simple game, but rather a competition to see who is the best nation. Sporting events also provide people with a sense of community, even within just local sporting leagues. Sports allow people to gather together and share a common goal, which is probably why so many people chose to include sports when describing their identity.

            <p> To create this image, I pasted paragraphs from the article that I found interesting / important into the word cloud generator. After pasting those paragraphs, this is the image that was created. The first thing I notice from this image is how large the words “hooligans” “football” and “men” are. I think that these three words summarize the article very well because they are all three important aspects of the nationalism described in the article. In the article, the nationalism described is heavily expressed through football and hooliganism. Also, those are both considered masculine things, which explains why men is also one of the largest words in the image. Fighting is also prevalent in the image, which is how these men (the hooligans) expressed their pride in their team/country. These men use football to express their nationalist beliefs, and also violence.
