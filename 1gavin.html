            <p> I was really interested in how gymnastics was used as a means of expression and the political connotations that it carried. One thing that particularly stuck out to me was how gymnastics as a sport differs from other sports. The limitless creativity that exists within it presents a beauty and art form that enables such political expression. Gymnastics is a sort of medium that allows athletes to express themselves in new ways. From Vera Caslavska to German working class people, it empowered people to stand for a cause they believed in. In the particular case of Turen, I found it really interesting how the meaning behind it evolved over time as it was used for different purposes. The struggle between the middle and class and the upper class presented a really captivating struggle and dynamic between the two classes. In the case of the Olympics, I was intrigued by how the character of nations were applied to gymnasts. Russian gymnasts were characterized by the documentary as being very disciplined and precise in their movements which fit in with the identity of the Soviet Union.

            <p> Major sports events seem to be able to unite different groups of people under a single national identity. During the FIFA documentary, people of many diverse backgrounds, and who may not always get along, united behind a single national team to express their love or passion for their country. Of course I think it is always appropriate to assume that FIFA was not going to show any person who spoke out against football or Brazil which was the focus of the documentary. In the context of the German team, I also think that major sports has the ability to include new identities into the national identity. The emphasis on diversity for the German team worked to expand what and who could be German. One thing that was especially striking was how players interpreted what it meant to be German- placing their allegiance to Germany not by taking part in ceremonial traditions like singing the national anthem rather by playing the game for their country.

            <p> Today we discussed hooliganism in Football. Hooligans are in part, sponsored by right-wing politicians who not only receive support from hooligans but also earn personal bodyguards while repaying the hooligans with bussing to fights and football games. The hooligans themselves are more focused on violence than football, however. Some hooligans said they care more about the fights than the games themselves. Hooligans have channeled alt-right and Neo-Nazi beliefs into their own identity, often targeting immigrants and foreigners. Especially in the case of Russia, hooliganism is a means to achieve a national identity, especially in trying to find what it means to be Russian following the collapse of the Soviet Union. \n I made this word cloud from sections of the article that I felt were important to understanding the role of hooliganism in Russia. One word that is small but I feel is important on the word cloud is “Kremlin” and a larger one, “Government” which appeared twice and three times respectively in the sections that I chose. I feel this is important because hooliganism has a large role in shaping far right politics in Russia. Russian politicians including Vladimir Putin have associated with firms as means of spreading their political power. This relation to far right politics in Russia goes hand in hand with rising nationalist sentiment in Russia and the racist rhetoric many football firms have adopted. With those two words in mind, I also think they relate to the words “racist” and “immigrants”. Firms target groups of immigrants, imposing their far-right nationalist values that are closely related to their connection with right leaning politicians in Russia.
