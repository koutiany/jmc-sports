            <p> I think that the most challenging part of the sports reading for me to fully understand was the rigid culture that the Turnen gymnastics team created in comparison to the much more artistic forms showcased in the documentary. The work done in the documentary really showed how personalized gymnastics can be, as the gymnasts all created unique routines to please the audiences and the judges as much as possible (Vera Caslavska using Mexican shoulder positioning in her Mexico City performance comes to mind as a good example of this). However, the reading really contrasted that, because it discussed how unified gymnastics was in 19th century Germany, and talked about how it was almost militaristic in nature. Overall, I think the reading and the documentary were great, and it was cool to see how gymnastics have two totally different sides to them-- individual performance and team/national unity.

            <p> In response to the first question (about the role of major sporting events in creating an idea of national belonging), I would say that they inevitably create at least some sense of national unity. National teams inherently try to embody the “idea” of the country that they are from in all of their presentations, from their uniforms, their name, the way they present themselves as representing their country, etc. I think we definitely see some examples in the materials for this class that show that this sense of national unity doesn’t necessarily apply to everybody, however. The reading that we did shows that despite being German citizens (and oftentimes people who were born in Germany), people on the German football team without ethnic German heritage found themselves to be deemed not as “representative” of Germany as the other members of the team by the public. Additionally, people from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds oftentimes find themselves in situations where they don’t have as much access to these national sports teams as other people in their country. When sports require the best of the best, it can be harder for people without the means to seek extra training, get professionals to help them train, etc. However, just because the idea of national unity doesn’t necessarily include everybody, it doesn’t mean that it’s not effective-- the documentary proves that major sporting events do bring together and unify a great deal of people, as it showcases people across Brazil from very different backgrounds who are all rooting for the same “Brazil” in the world cup.

            <h2 class="display-4">Reflection on week 3</h2>
            <p>  This week we learned about football hooligans across Europe and in Russia in particular. Looking at the wordcloud of our reading on the hooligans, there are a couple of obvious words included, like “hooligans,” “football,” or “Russian.” But it’s some of the smaller words that I think perhaps say a lot about the hooligans. Take, for example, “young.” We learned about how many of the hooligans are young, white, lower/middle class men, and often were outspokenly unhappy with society for one reason or another. Many of them were unhappy due to their perceived financial situation, but they were also generally unhappy about other societal norms. The word “Nazi” in the wordcloud is representative of the alt-right or racist tendencies that the hooligans tend to express. We learned about how they create racist chants and openly dislike minorities on the basis of their skin color. Finally, we learned about aspects  of the violence that the hooligans bring, and how oftentimes, the fights aren’t personal. Watching the documentary on the hooligans showed that many hooligans meet up to fight people who they don’t know anything about-- other than the fact that they are supporters of an opposing team. This culture of having such strong enemies of people who the hooligans oftentimes don’t know personally is an aspect of what makes hooligan culture seem so surprising to an outside perspective.
