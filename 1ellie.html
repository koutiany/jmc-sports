            <p>  Our first honors meeting was incredibly eye-opening, as it challenged the notion of sports as a form of entertainment and presented it as a deeply political act. Sports don’t exist in a vacuum; rather, they set the tone for politics (and vice versa). Though I was previously familiar with the stories of Olympic gymnastics and the development of the sport as it relates to gender, aesthetics, and age, I was unaware of just how much the sport reflects national values and occurrences. Gymnastics, unlike most sports, possesses the unique ability to test the limits of its athletes as well as incorporating the elements of artistry and audience. This makes it an especially valuable form of expression. Additionally, I had never learned about gymnastics in the context of German nationalism and as both a recreational and militaristic act. This reading, while a bit challenging, allowed me to understand the impact of the sport on ordinary people, not just a handful of the world’s greatest athletes. I have never been an athlete, so while I understand the feeling of unity from the perspective of a fan, I have never deeply considered how participation in sports works as an act of nation-building. As we move on from our discussion of gymnastics, I still have a lot of questions. I plan on doing some more reading on German gymnastics and working to understand how the patterns established in the early days of Olympic gymnastics have set the stage for more recent events, particularly in the United States, knowing that this is especially relevant to our school and community.

            <h2 class="display-4">Reflection on week 2</h2>
            <p> Session #2’s discussion was incredibly nuanced, and I think we dug deep into how sports interacts with or shapes national identity. Though I am not very knowledgeable about soccer/football, especially outside of the US, I still found my mind buzzing with connections to concepts I know more about, allowing me to build a more comprehensive understanding of the central questions. Though comlex, I think it is important to note that sports do hold the power to bring nations together and produce an almost-unbelievable level of comradeship. As evidenced by the FIFA video, there are people from all walks of life, even who are a part of marginalized groups whose country they are rooting for perpetuates their marginalization, who feel deeply devoted to and uplifted by the sport. This is where the lens of narrative comes into play. The story of athletics fostering national unity is the palatable and feel-good one, the narrative that corporations like FIFA, the NFL, etc. will use to their advantage as they simultaneously use sports as a mechanism to exploit communities or movements. The rhetoric that FIFA uses in their video is purposeful and sanitized. I also couldn’t help but relate our conversation to the idea of sports corporations using social movements as a trend or a tool rather than as a mechanism for substantive action. In the US, it’s the NFL using Black Lives Matter as a marketing tool to create an illusion of racial justice while refusing to reckon with its own complicity. In soccer, it’s Germany building and celebrating a “multicultural team” as a distraction for social discontent and sentiments that rejected this multicultural model in the broader nation. In Brazil, it’s featuring ordinary people in promotional content when, in reality, the presence of sporting events in the nation has disproportionately benefitted the wealthy and has affected the livelihoods of working class people. While the corporations’ efforts are deliberate and effective, they create contradictions that make true unity and solidarity an impossibility. Additionally, I think the idea of regional solidarity in sport is interesting. On a domestic level, I see this all the time (as a Chicago Bears fan from metro-Detroit). People largely cling onto the teams that they live near, though geographic location is just a matter of chance. In the context of Germany, I am interested in how the 2014 win compared to wins in the past considering the context. European nations are currently dealing with increasing interconnectedness and a commitment to transcending national borders through the European Union, so how do these more cosmopolitan practices impact national identity when it comes to sport? Would someone from Germany be more likely to root for France when they play against the US because they share an aspect of national identity, or is the EU too young and decentralized to produce this comradeship? These are questions I don’t have an answer to, but that the media from this lesson encouraged me to consider.

            <h2 class="display-4">Reflection on week 3</h2>
            <p> For week 3, I made a mind map to try and specify some of the big ideas that came up a lot in the video, article, and subsequent class discussion. Before this week, I had no idea what hooliganism was, as my understanding of sports and nationalism is domestic. Though we don’t have hooliganism in the United States, a lot of the larger sentiments and themes behind it, as shown in my mind map, characterize the allure of sports. For example, “identity” is a big umbrella term from our discussion. There is national identity, the general idea of nation-states building a sense of identity and pride after the fall of the Soviet Union, which influenced the rise of hooliganism, and personal identity, which intersects with the racial and gender identities of hooligans, most of whom are white men and whose participation in hooliganism validates their already-dominant identities in a changing world. In terms of the appeals of hooliganism, I was initially unsure as to why anyone would subject themselves to this pain and suffering. However, the article does a good job of detailing not only the camaraderie fostered by hooliganism but also the financial allure of hooliganism, as it provides opportunities for upward mobility that simply aren’t present in other fields.  After our conversation, I still have a lot of questions about hooliganism, specifically its connection to the specific teams and how that relationship works (or doesn’t).
