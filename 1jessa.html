            <p> Response to second class:First question
Major sports events play the role of uniting the nation together, from my understanding and the video we watched/piece we read and from seeing the ways people act around sports. I was an au pair in Spain for a few months before college and the concept of FIFA as an organization that literally everyone had a stake in was striking to me. Playing soccer or being at matches was an integral part of life, and so much part of the culture.  I remember at one point, the regional team had won a game to make them into the same division as Barcelona, and the celebration was endless, involving people from all walks of life and supporting the team colors for days on end. Titi made the point that its almost like a religion, which I totally agree with. Especially thinking about how flags and symbols represent the colors of a nation and thereby the team, this plays a big role in identity. Nations that want to represent themselves and do not have the independence, strength or statehood to do so in other senses seem to have the opportunity to through sports and games.

            <p>Third Class: Hooligans graphic Looking at the Guardian article on this topic, I chose a section that seemed to emphasize the neo-nazism of the practices. Along with the violence, it is shocking to learn the religious or just cultural/symbolic meaning behind what these groups are representing and believe they are a part of. The racism and facsim aspects that support the fights speak to a larger issue that is highlighted in the word bubble I think, that this took place in 2017, more than half a century after WW2 and people are still representing those ideas. The right-wing extremism that is the further idea the group pushes onto the young men they pull in becomes a troublesome unifier. The violence still shows through but this section particularly highlighted the symbols and chants used in these fights and rallying cries that push these men to fight.
