            <p> At Wednesday’s meeting we discussed the idea of body movement in sports, specifically gymnastics, as a language.  I found it interesting how the visual aspect of gymnastics can function as lingua franca for a nation, uniting a people with something as accessible and universal as sight and body.  We also discussed the importance of whose body is performing the movement, that is, the importance of representation in national sports.  Because a national team in some ways serves as a synecdoche for the entire country, it is important that the team members reflect the citizens of that country.  The team also shows how the country wishes to see itself—whether that be young, confident, strong, multiracial, stoic, middle-class, etc.  In the case of Olga Korbut and her emotional reaction to her botched routine, the world’s sympathy for her translated to the humanization of Russia itself, showing the great power of athletes, especially gymnasts, not only to represent but to embody their home nations.

            <p> In our first meeting, we discussed how sports can mold perceptions of a nation both within it and without.  In the most recent meeting, we saw this in reverse, with nations actively using sports to mold an idealized version of their identities.  The German national soccer team’s multicultural origins facilitated a national narrative of inclusiveness and racial accord, regardless of the sometimes-contradictory experiences of Germany’s immigrant communities.  The team’s diverse identity also served as a public-relations campaign outside of Germany, displaying to the world a facet of the “new Germany” that might counteract international concerns about the increasing influence of its then-newly-formed far-right party, Alternative for Germany (AfD).  In a similar way, the Brazilian national soccer team also allowed an appearance of national unity as portrayed in the FIFA film for the 2014 World Cup.  The tensions between native Amazonians and the Brazilian government, between rural and urban workers, and between the underprivileged and the wealthy were underplayed by the film’s emphasis on a shared national passion for the game.  Both examples show the way that national sports present an opportunity for nations to craft a unified, cooperative identity for international onlookers, with important implications for world politics and diplomacy.

            <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane.
