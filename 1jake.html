            <p>Week One: I found it fascinating how the athletes were using the ever-changing nature of gymnastics in order to bring honor and glory to their nation in competitions. Since there is no ceiling to the performance, gymnasts are able to push the limits of their performances in order to draw attention to the skillset of their nation (especially shown with Kato and Japan). Another aspect that interested me was with gymnast Olga Korbut when she botched her performance and was seen crying, defying all stereotypes about the stone-faced resilience of Soviet women. This reverts from the stereotypical associations outsiders make about a country as the world got to see that the communists were people just like the westerners. Outside of the performance, I found it interesting how Věra Čáslavská was able to use her successes in gymnastics to bring awareness and protest against the Soviets in Czechoslovakia. She was able to usher in national unity behind her performance and protest during the Soviet anthem to show her contempt peacefully. The topic I found the most challenging was the Turnen movement, specifically the divide between the middle class and upper class styles of the sport.

            <h2 class="display-4">Reflection on week 2</h2>
            <p>Week Two: I believe that national sporting events are a way to bring the nation together, no matter their differences. In the context of the United States, I believe that the nation becomes more unified and patriotic watching athletes of all different backgrounds that are composed of different identities compete to win. For example, throughout history, many minority athletes were able to pave the way for the fight for social justice and equality and thus promote more belonging to a nation. I see this occur today as people rally behind athletes who are their role models, while the athletes have a platform to spread the word about issues and injustices. Despite this, I do believe that major sporting events can also bring about a superiority complex to various nations. For example, the United States consistently wins a plurality of the medals at Olympic games, and thus, through sports, the notion of American excellence that is so potent in American culture today is advanced by our performance in sports. Similarly, these sporting events also give clues as to who belongs versus who does not based on their individual performance. Hateful people can use an athlete's performance to justify their intolerance and exclusion. Sentiments like this were apparent during the FIFA World Cup propaganda film. This film was used to paint a facade of the unity of different cultures in Brazil, while openly ignoring many of the issues that face the nation, including that of the Amazonian people and low income individuals. After all, FIFA was trying to make themselves look good in order to turn a profit, so it makes sense why they would ignore many of the social issues that their platform could have used to spread awareness about. In Germany, their fans were upset that their team was not made up of only ethnic Germans. In addition to this, many of these right-wing individuals also wish that the nation was made up of only ethnic Germans. Despite this, the team was representative of the nation as a whole, since Germany is going through a demographic change that many hateful individuals despise and see the ethnic change in their escape of football.

            <p>Week Three: I decided to make a word cloud based on the article about right-wing extremism in Russian hooliganism. In addition to this, I also looked at the analytics of the words that were used in order to  make some findings about the nature of hooliganism. The first thing that I immediately noticed was the frequency of words like “racist,” “[far] right,” and “nazi.” While the title of the article made it apparent that nazism is rampant in hooliganism, I was surprised by the number of individuals who shared these beliefs and acted on them while trying to recruit more “young men.” That was the other thing that shocked me, was the age of the individuals who were resorting to “violence” and hooliganism. The article followed the story of a man who would join the fights from a young age and normalized the violence, hate, and intolerance. These words show how a form of masculine, ethno-nationalism can seep into the lives of something as innocent as sports to spread hatred and traditionalism. Not only that, but the frequency of words shows how this far-right reaction is growing as Europe becomes more diverse. Similarly, the youth and Russian government sponsor these actions, so there is little hope for education and understanding and more threat of nationalism and intolerance.
