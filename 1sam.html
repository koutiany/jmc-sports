            <p>Week 1: Some concepts of sports that challenge me today is the pressure they face when it comes to performing both athletically and the kinds of social circumstances that comes with gymnastics. It was interesting how gymnastics was largely of working class young men, because I would imagine that the gym could be open to everyone. I think this is because it is an attractive setting to be in, because it is not just a place to workout but also to belong with people that are as like minded as you.

            <h2 class="display-4">Reflection on week 2</h2>
            <p>Week 2: What of the stand out points of the video was about how meaningful the Brazilian World Cup meant to everyone in Brazil. It must be said though that the video was done by FIFA as part of their promotion program. This is meaningful because they obviously want the World Cup to be as hyped up as possible and this is done by making everyone feel amped to watch their team. Because this video is staging the event this way it is worth considering what the actual attitude of the nation is like towards the team. I think when considering the rural villagers and how they were in tune with the team and looking forward to them competing that it is infact a unifying event. There is definitely inequality when it comes to the background of the players on the team because for many, it comes from years of being apart of expensive club teams. The best teams often matured from a young age with the help of their parents who have the means and the time to enroll their children. It calls into question how people in the countryside who are not afforded these kinds of opportunities see themselves in the greater picture of Brazilian soccer. I think soccer itself is unifying enough because it is super fun to watch people born in the same area as you take their skills to the global spectacle. Watching these players be better or worse than other players from different countries is a source of national pride because sport creates an event playingfield where the better talent wins out. I think people can identity with this because while they are not afforded the same kinds of opportunities as others, a place where these things can be thrown aside and becomes a space where purpose is exposed.

            <h2 class="display-4">Reflection on week 3</h2>
            <p>Week 3: I chose this selection of the text because I found it the most attention grabbing because of the first hand detailing of the violence that the hooligans perpertrate and why. Their relationship with Russia and to that of Europe as a whole is very pronounced because the hooligans are distinctively naitonalist. What is most compelling about the graphic is the size of the word “one” and the size of the word “supporters”. It is almost as if the two words should contrast, but when looking back at the text the message is described. In this portion of the text, they are just intrdocuting the audience to the hooligans and the word “one” is used to refer to a number of different times when the hooligans were out of control. One such time was when an English can got their achilles sliced, one time someone was left paralyzed, and another was when one Russian hooligan spoke for the group. The supporters is so large because at this stage of the paper they are introducing the reader to the fact that there a number of supporters of this group. I found this interesting because while there are number of supporters within that of the group of hooligans, it is in my opinion that I wouldn’t call them supporters of a team. To me these hooligans are barbaric with similar nationalist ideologies that just so happen to meet up at soccer games. I think it is worth considering that they are only interested in soccer just to get at the British and French because they understand what soccer means to them. The nature of hooligans is meant to be disruptive which I feel the graphic can identity.
